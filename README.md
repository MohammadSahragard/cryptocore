# Cryptocore

### About the app
> Cryptocore is marketplace for cryptocurrencies that gets its data from a real API ([CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com)). I designed the UI for this project myself and I believe it was a good experience for the first time. Cryptocore is a sample work for my resume.

### Challanges
Cryptocore was the first project I developed using Next.js. I had previously worked on this project using React, but once I learned Next.js, I was excited to quickly develop a project with this technology. This first project presented many challenges and enjoyable experiences for me, and I learned a lot along the way.<br>
